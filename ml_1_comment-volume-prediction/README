ABSTRACT='The leading treads towards social networking services had drawn massive
public attention from last one and half decade. The amount of data that is
uploaded to these social networking services is increasing day by day. So,
there is massive requirement to study the highly dynamic behavior of users
towards these services. This is a preliminary work to model the user
patterns and to study the effectiveness of machine learning predictive
modeling approaches on leading social networking service Facebook. We
modeled the user comment patters, over the posts on Facebook Pages and
predicted that how many comments a post is expected to receive in next H
hrs. In order to automate the process, we developed a software prototype
consisting of the crawler, Information extractor, information processor and
knowledge discovery module. We used Neural Networks and Decision Trees,
predictive modeling techniques on different dataset variants and evaluated
them under Hits(at)10 (custom measure), Area Under Curve, Evaluation Time
and Mean Absolute error evaluation metrics. We concluded that the Decision
trees performed better than the Neural Networks under light of all
evaluation metrics.'
